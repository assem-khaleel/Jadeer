First, the eligibility criteria specify a series of core values and guiding principles that AACSB believes are important. Accounting academic units must demonstrate a commitment to these values and guiding principles in order to achieve and continue AACSB accounting accreditation. Second, they provide a foundation for peer review by defining the scope of review; establishing an agreement about the accounting accreditation entity to be reviewed; and determining that entityâ€™s organization and support in the context of accounting education, as well as its connections to business and management education. Third, eligibility criteria address certain basic characteristics that bear on the quality of accounting and business degree programs, research, and other activities. These characteristics must be present before an applicant can be reviewed for initial accounting accreditation or for the continuation of accounting accreditation. Unless an applicant can describe itself transparently as an entity delivering accounting education and research, and show that it has the structure and capacity to deliver and sustain high-quality accounting education and intellectual contributions, it is not ready to be evaluated against the standards. <br/> <br/>'

As such, the documentation an accounting academic unit provides in response to the criteria is a signal of its commitment to the underlying core values outlined in the criteria and its likelihood of achieving accreditation in a reasonable period. Eligibility criteria are thus the basis for the eligibility application. <br/> <br/>'
